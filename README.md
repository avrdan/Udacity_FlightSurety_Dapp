# FlightSurety

FlightSurety is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course.

It is a blockchain-based flight insurance solution, where:

* Airlines are added to a smart contract if they provide funding and register
* Airlines can vote to add new airlines to the pool
* Passengers can request insurance from the airlines
* The contract pays the passengers in the case of an insured event (i.e: flight is delayed)
